# GasTracker
Welcome to the GasTracker repo. This is the code for the GasTracker project, available at [gastracker.eu](https://gastracker.eu).

### What is Gastracker?
GasTracker is an online tool to record and track your car gas consumption. Each time you refuel, input some data about the refuel and it calculates the average consumption of your car. As you refuel more and more, the data becomes more accurate and displays the average consumption of your car.

### What tools was it made with?
The platform was built using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). The current production website is hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) as a cloud database provider. The icons are from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) and the illustrations are from [Undraw](https://undraw.co/).

### Why was it built?
Well, my car, despite not being old, does not track fuel consumption. I enjoy statistics on mundane stuff, so I kept a small book tracking how much money I spent on each refuel and ocasionally calculated the average consumption. This projects replaces that small book with a proper solution. Plus I wanted to build something using Nuxt so here it is.

### Can I use it myself?  
Sure, you can create an account, add vehicles and track their consumptions. I do not have ads, nor do I sell the user data. The only tracking actived is Google Analytics.

### Are any future features planned?
The development of this project is pretty much closed, so do not expect many more features to be added. Either way I would like to add multi language support, as the project is only in Portuguese (with Portuguese fuel brands) right now.
If enough users join and use the website, I would like to display a page with statistics on which fuel brand is more efficient.

### Can I make a suggestion?
Sure, get in touch at [geral@gastracker.eu](mailto:geral@gastracker.eu) and I will get back at you as soon as possible.
